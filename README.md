## Hi there, ðŸ‘‹ I want to introduce you to my application that I developed using ASP.NET Core MVC, C#, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript language.

-Requesting e-mail confirmation after users become members and activating membership after clicking the link sent to their e-mail

-Filtering products by category

-Adding/deleting and updating products to the cart

-Detail of the products in the basket and payment after approval (tested by iyzico integration)

-An admin panel, which is not visible to members, has been prepared and necessary controls and order details can be monitored

-In the admin panel, operations such as authorization management, opening a new category, new product entry, as well as editing and deleting can be done.
